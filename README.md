# HR_Isights_Data_Analytics_Project

The problem statement of this project was to discover the patterns of employee behavior when it comes to their preferences, for example, on which days most employees take work from home, in which months they take most sick leaves, etc. In this project, I have used a real-life data set of a company containing attendance data including information about working from home, sick leaves, holidays etc. 

The key steps involved in this project: 
- Defining the problem statement (tracking employee preferences)
- Data Loading (via MS Excel)
- Data Cleaning and ETL (Using Power BI Power Query)
- Creating Metrics (Using DAX)
- Dashboarding (Using DAX)
