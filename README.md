# HR_Isights_Data_Analytics_Project

The problem statement of this project was to discover the patterns of employee behaviour when it comes to their preferences, for example, on which days most employees take work from home, in which months do they take most sick leaves and etc. In this project I have used a real life data set of a company containing the attendence data including information about work from home, sick leaves, holidays etcetera. 

The key steps involved in this project: 
- Defining the problem statement (tracking employee prefernces)
- Data Loading (via MS Excel)
- Data Cleaning and ETL (Using Power BI Power Query)
- Dashboarding (Using DAX)
